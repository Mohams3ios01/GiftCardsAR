# GiftCardsAR
### GiftCardsAR allows you to use ARKit 2 and Image Tracking to quickly view the balances of your gift and points cards.

In my example, I added two cards - one was a gift card for a movie theatre, and the other was a points membership card for a drug store. When the app identified one of the two cards, it would show the appropriate logo along with a balance (in this case either a dollar amount or points amount) on top of the card.

Please note that the balances for each of the two cards are set amounts. This is because none of the retailers in my example has public developer APIs that woudl allow me to fetch that information - which is a bummer :/ 

Either way, this is just a fun little prototype that allowed me to experiment with ARKit 2 - not really something that I could see anyone or even myself using. Actual AR products should be more significantly helpful and not just underwhelmingly fun. In any case, this was a fun way to learn!
